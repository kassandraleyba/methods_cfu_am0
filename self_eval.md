# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
    I feel pretty confident with the built-in Ruby methods. Ruby docs has been the most helpful tool if I'm looking for anything in particular. Sometimes I'll start with google if I have a description but I always move on to ruby docs! It's amazing and full of so much information!

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I feel pretty confident writing simple methods. I struggled with the last practice question on the final practice file:

first_name = "Kassandra"
middle_name = "Paige"
last_name = "Leyba"

def greet_person(first_name, middle_name, last_name)
    "Hola, #{first_name} #{middle_name} #{last_name}!"
end

puts greet_person(first_name, middle_name, last_name)

I think I confused myself with hashes when I started, but got the code to return a value. I want to make sure this is what you're looking for with this exercise and to make sure this is the simplest way to write this!

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
I want to make sure my syntax is correct and I'm using the correct vocabulary when typing out explanations. If you have any feedback on what I've submitted that would help me! I want to make sure I can explain the steps correctly and thoroughly especially when working on driver/navigator tasks/projects in the future!
